# BEAMMP-JOBSMISSION-BASE

Within a week or so i made a BEAMMP server which has features such as 
- Basic economy
- Buy vehicles
- Buy parts
- Delivery missions

More to possibly add
- Taxi jobs
- Cop job?
- Criminal job?
- Trailer cargo jobs
- Truck driving jobs


My goal is to allow people to easily customize and build their own BEAMMP servers as most servers on beammp right now are bare bones.. apart from a few which arent open source (to my knowledge).   On arma 3 their was a base template for rp server with economy and shit to easily allow people to get into coding their own magnificent server so im trying to do the same for beammp


right now its not really in a good state to release the code as its a bit messy. so alot of refactoring and tweaking and optimizing as basically wrote it all in a week.
